# Anagram Game

A competitive multiplayer game which allows for realtime gameplay with your friends. Each round a random 10 letter word is picked and its letters are shuffled. Players must make as many words as they can from these 10 letters (each word must have 3 letters or more). The number of points gained from each word is equal to the length of the word in letters. The winner is the player with the highest score.

This app was made using React on the frontend with Firebase to store the game state. Another API was also made using Express and MySQL to host a dictionary for verifying that a submitted word exists in the English dictionary.
